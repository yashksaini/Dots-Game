## Introduction
Dots Game is a two-player web-based game where the players aim to join the dots by clicking the line. The game board consists of 25 dots arranged in a 5x5 grid. The player who completes the last side of a box gets to fill that box with their color (Red or Blue). The objective is to fill as many boxes as possible to win the match. Additionally, players get an extra chance after completing a box.
